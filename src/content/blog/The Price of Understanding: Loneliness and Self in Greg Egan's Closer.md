No one wants to spend eternity alone. Yet, in the end, we have no choice.

Sian and Michael, the two main characters in _Closer_, have different motivations. Sian constantly seeks new and exciting experiences, while Michael is fixated on one question: can human beings ever truly understand each other?

They try everything—sharing their past, exploring their childhood memories, even switching bodies. They go to extreme lengths, even using "Extras" to fully immerse themselves in each other’s experiences.

But despite all of this, Michael still feels isolated. No matter how much they share, or how deeply a book or conversation resonates with him, he realizes that it can never truly offer a glimpse into someone’s soul. As he puts it, "Language evolved to help us conquer the physical world, not to describe subjective reality. Love, anger, jealousy, resentment, grief—all these emotions are defined through external circumstances and observable actions." When a metaphor strikes a chord, it only proves that he and the author share the same cultural definitions, not that they've achieved any real understanding.

Michael believes that to truly understand another person, you need to be identical in both "data" and "program"—not just sharing experiences, but also processing them the same way.

So, they undergo the ultimate experiment. For eight hours, they sync completely, sharing memories and thoughts. They know exactly what the other is thinking, feeling, and remembering.

After the experiment, they break up. Not because of any irreconcilable differences or unforgivable actions, but because they had achieved complete understanding. For Sian, this was the problem. She had always valued the sense of _otherness_ in a relationship. Without it, as she saw it, “you might as well be talking to yourself.”

So, no one wants to be alone forever. But in some ways, we have to be. The very limits of understanding between individuals are what allow us to define who we are. Loneliness, in this sense, is proof of our individuality. Losing yourself in someone else may not lead to loneliness, but that’s because you’ve surrendered your sense of self.

We have to accept that empathy has its limits, and we will never truly know what it’s like to be someone else. This realization leaves me feeling both sad and strangely relieved.
